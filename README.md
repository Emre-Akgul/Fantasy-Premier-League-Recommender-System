# Fantasy Premier League Team Selection Project

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning and optimization algorithms for creating an optimized Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team selection. It aims to maximize points through informed decision-making based on player performance predictions.

## Data Source
This project uses data from the Fantasy Premier League historical dataset:

Title: FPL Historical Dataset  
Author: Anand, Vaastav  
Year: 2023  
Source: Retrieved November 30th, 2023, from https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League/

## Features
- **Player Performance Prediction**: Implements a Random Forest Regressor model trained on extensive player data.
- **Team Optimization**: Utilizes a SCIP solver-based algorithm considering FPL rules to optimize team selection.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Enhances search efficiency, outperforming average FPL manager scores.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Python, Scikit-learn, Google OR-Tools.
2. **Installation**: Clone this repo and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Usage**: Execute the main script to generate your optimized team. Adjust parameters as needed.
